This file contains a list of functions and example uses for the NetworkUtils
backend.

Assume that "g" is an igraph graph object.

Basic
=====

Vertex Count:
-------------
Usage:
    vcount(g)

Arguments:
    g: The graph object.

Returns:
    The number of vertices in the graph as an integer.

Edge Count:
-----------
Usage:
    ecount(g)

Arguments:
    g: The graph object.

Returns:
    The number of edges in the graph as an integer.

List Vertex Attributes:
-----------------------
Usage:
    list.vertex.attributes(g)

Arguments:
    g: The graph object.

Returns:
    A vector of strings containing the names of the attributes of the vertices
    in g.

List Edge Attributes:
---------------------
Usage:
    list.edge.attributes(g)

Arguments:
    g: The grpah object.

Returns:
    A vector of strings containing the names of the attributes of the edges in
    g.

Subsetting
==========

Subset by Vertices:
-------------------
Usage:
    vertex_subset(g, subset_str)

Arguments:
    g: The graph object.
    subset_str: A boolean expression as a string. May contain names of vertex
        attributes as variables.

Returns:
    An igraph object containing only vertices whose attributes satisfy the
    expression in subset_str. Only edges that are incident to the remaining
    vertices are retained.

Example:
    #Overwrites g with a graph only containing vertices whose zipcode is
    #02139.
    g <- vertex_subset(g, "zipcode==\"02139\"")

Subset by Edges:
----------------
Usage:
    edge_subset(g, subset_str, drop_disconnected)

Arguments:
    g: The graph object.
    subset_str: A boolean expression as a string. May contain names of edge
        attributes as variables.
    drop_disconnected: A bool controlling whether or not to drop vertices that
        are disconnected (not incident to any edge) after edges are subsetted.
        Set to FALSE by default, thus returning a graph with the same number
        of vertices as the original.

Returns:
    An igraph object containing only edges whose attributes satisfy the
    expression in subset_str. Depending on the value of drop_disconnected, the
    returned object may no longer contain disconnected vertices.

Example:
    #Overwrites g with a graph containing only edges corresponding to
    #collaborations earlier than 2001. Because the drop_disconnected argument
    #is omitted, no vertices will be dropped even if they are disconnected after
    #subsetting, but the number of edges does drop as expected.
    vcount(g)
    ecount(g)
    g <- edge_subset(g, "appyear <= 2001")
    vcount(g)
    ecount(g)

    #This time the disconnected vertices get dropped and the vertex
    g <- edge_subset(g, "appyear <= 2001", drop_disconnected=TRUE)
    vcount(g)

Intelligent Subsetting
======================

Component Extraction:
---------------------
Usage:
    component(g, num)

Arguments:
    g: The graph object.
    num: The number of the component to be extracted, where 1 is the biggest,
        2 is the second biggest, etc, where size is measured by number of
        vertices in the component. Ties are broken arbitrarily.

Returns:
    An igraph object which contains the largest component of the input graph.

Adding Measures
===============

Degree:
-------
Usage:
    add_degree(g)

Arguments:
    g: The graph object.

Returns:
    An igrpah object 

PageRank:
---------
Usage:
    add_pagerank(g, d)

Arguments:
    g: The graph object.
    d: The damping parameter in PageRank. It determines the baseline
        importance of an individual independent of their connectedness in the
        graph. 

Returns:
    An igraph object identical to the input graph but with an additional vertex
    attribute corresponding to the PageRank of the vertex.
