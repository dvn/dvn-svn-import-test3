If you need to replicate a UNF:3 for a Stata or SPSS data
set, please follow these steps: 

Download the DSB rpm version 1.5, archived <here>. [insert
URL once we freeze and archive the rpm]

Install R package UNF version 3 available <here>. [insert
URL] 

Run the appropriate converter script on your data file:
readdta.pl, readpor.pl or and readsav.pl for the Stata,
SPSS/por and SPSS/sav file formats respectively.

This will produce an XML file in the DDI fromat with the
UNFs for the individual variables and the combined UNF for
the datafile.

A note on the UNF:3 implementation:


It was discovered that the UNF:3 implementation was affected
by certain behavior that was language-specific and/or
operated on data object in non-canonical forms. There are at
least 2 known examples: handling of Date and Time objects by
R; and drop in precision and rounding of floating point
values while the data values were extracted from the Stata
files. (see the documentation file
UNF3_Implementation_Details.txt for more information). All
the UNF signatures generated in the DVN <2.0 relied on that
implementation. For this reason we strongly recommend that
when it is necessary to replicate UNF:3, the preserved DVN
UNF:3 software (above) is used, to achieve the result that
is guaranteed to be identical.
